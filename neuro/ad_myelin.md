# Myelin and Alzheimer's disease

## Myelin dysfunction drives amyloid-β deposition in models of Alzheimer’s disease

[Depp _et al._, 2023](#depp2023myelin)

- Brain ageing affects olygodendrocytes and the structure of myelin sheaths 
  ([Bowley _et al._, 2010](#bowley2010age)).
- Myelin sheaths integrity is is associated with secondary neuroinflammation 
  (Safaiyan _et al._, [2016](#safaiyan2016age), [2021](#safaiyan2021white))
- Oligodendrocytes support axonal energy metabolism and neuronal health 
  ([Griffiths _et al._, 1998](griffiths1998axonal); [Fünfschilling _et al._, 2012](#funfschilling2012glycolytic); 
  [Lee _et al._, 2012](#lee2012oligodendroglia); [Saab _et al._, 2016](#saab2016oligodendroglial)).
- **Hypothesis:** loss of myelin integrity can be an upstream risk factor for neuronal Aβ deposition.
- **Results:** identify genetic pathways of myelin dysfunction and demyelinating injuries as potent drivers of amyloid deposition in mouse models of AD.

Why does myelin deteriorate with age?
- Olygodendricytes live longer: low generation/turnover rate ([Yeung _et al._, 2014](#yeung2014dynamics)).
- The specific cellular architecture of myelin makes protein and lipid turnover challenging and slow
  ([Toyama _et al._, 2013](#toyama2013identification); [Ando _et al._, 2003](#ando2003turnover)).

Myelin decline in patients with AD:
- [Salat _et al._, 2005](#salat2005age): As expected from prior volumetric and DTI studies, prefrontal FA was reduced in older adults (OA) compared to young adults (YA). Although WM volume has been reported to be relatively preserved until late aging, FA was significantly reduced by middle age. Much of prefrontal WM showed reduced FA with increasing age. Ventromedial and deep prefrontal regions showed a somewhat greater reduction compared to other prefrontal areas. Prefrontal WM anisotropy correlated with prefrontal WM volume, but the correlation was significant only when the analysis was limited to participants over age 40.
- [Naggara _et al._, 2006](#naggara2006diffusion): In AD, MD was increased in the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the WM in the frontal and parietal lobes. FA was bilaterally decreased in the WM of the temporal lobe, the frontal lobe and the splenium compared with corresponding regions in controls. No correlations were found between the MMSE score and the anisotropy indices. Findings of DTI reveal abnormalities in the frontal and temporal WM in early AD patients. 
- [Ringman _et al._, 2007](#ringman2007diffusion): Fractional anisotropy is reduced in WM of preclinical and presymptomatic FAD mutation carriers, particularly in the late-myelinating tracts connecting limbic structures.
- [Gouw _et al._, 2008](#gouw2008heterogeneity): (ex vivo qMRI) lower FA + higher T1 in WMH than in normal WM in all groups. Significant tissue x group found for T1.  Axonal density was an independent determinant of FA, whereas T1 was independently determined by axonal and myelin density and microglial activation.
- [Dean _et al._, 2017](#dean2017association): Widespread age-related changes to myelin were observed across the brain, particularly in late myelinating brain regions such as frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum. Quantitative relaxometry measures were negatively associated with levels of CSF biomarkers across brain white matter and in areas preferentially affected in AD. Furthermore, significant age-by-biomarker interactions were observed between myelin water fraction and phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42, suggesting that phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42 levels modulate age-related changes in myelin water fraction.
- [Wang _et al._, 2019](#wang2019quantification): (NII == neuroinflammation imaging) Elevated NII-derived cellular diffusivity was observed in both preclinical and early symptomatic phases of AD, while disruption of WM integrity, as detected by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD), was only observed in the symptomatic phase of AD. This may suggest that WM inflammation occurs earlier than WM damage following abnormal Aβ accumulation in AD. The negative correlation between NII-derived cellular diffusivity and CSF Aβ42 level (a marker of amyloidosis) may indicate that WM inflammation is associated with increasing Aβ burden. NII-derived FA also negatively correlated with CSF t-tau level (a marker of neurodegeneration), suggesting that disruption of WM integrity is associated with increasing neurodegeneration.
- [Araque Caballera _et al._, 2018](#araquecaballero2018white): Results showed a significant interaction of mutations status by estimated years from symptom onset, i.e. a stronger increase of mean diffusivity, within the posterior parietal and medial frontal white matter in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers. The earliest increase of mean diffusivity was observed in the forceps major, forceps minor and long projecting fibres-many connecting default mode network regions-between 5 to 10 years before estimated symptom onset. Higher mean diffusivity in fibre tracts was associated with lower grey matter volume in the tracts' projection zones. Global mean diffusivity was correlated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β1-42 but higher levels of tau, phosphorylated-tau and soluble TREM2. Together, these results suggest that regionally selective white matter degeneration occurs years before the estimated symptom onset.
