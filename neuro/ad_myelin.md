  As expected from prior volumetric and DTI studies, prefrontal FA was reduced in older adults (OA) 
  compared to young adults (YA). Although WM volume has been reported to be relatively preserved until 
  late aging, FA was significantly reduced by middle age. Much of prefrontal WM showed reduced FA with 
  increasing age. Ventromedial and deep prefrontal regions showed a somewhat greater reduction compared 
  to other prefrontal areas. Prefrontal WM anisotropy correlated with prefrontal WM volume, but the 
  correlation was significant only when the analysis was limited to participants over age 40.

  In AD, MD was increased in the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the WM in the frontal and parietal lobes. 
  FA was bilaterally decreased in the WM of the temporal lobe, the frontal lobe and the splenium compared with 
  corresponding regions in controls. No correlations were found between the MMSE score and the anisotropy indices.
  Findings of DTI reveal abnormalities in the frontal and temporal WM in early AD patients.

  Diffusion index abnormalities in the SLF were the sign of a subtle microstructural injury not 
  detected by standard atrophy measures in the corresponding gray matter regions. The microstructural 
  measure obtained in the left hippocampus using diffusion imaging showed the most substantial differences 
  between the two groups and was the best single predictor of future progression to AD. An optimal 
  prediction model (91% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, 96% specificity) was obtained by combining MRI 
  measures and CSF protein biomarkers.

  Widespread age-related changes to myelin were observed across the brain, particularly in 
  late myelinating brain regions such as frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum. 
  Quantitative relaxometry measures were negatively associated with levels of CSF biomarkers across 
  brain white matter and in areas preferentially affected in AD. Furthermore, significant age-by-biomarker 
  interactions were observed between myelin water fraction and phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42, 
  suggesting that phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42 levels modulate age-related changes in myelin water fraction.

  Results showed a significant interaction of mutations status by estimated years from symptom onset, 
  i.e. a stronger increase of mean diffusivity, within the posterior parietal and medial frontal white 
  matter in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers. The earliest increase of mean diffusivity was 
  observed in the forceps major, forceps minor and long projecting fibres-many connecting default mode 
  network regions-between 5 to 10 years before estimated symptom onset. Higher mean diffusivity in fibre 
  tracts was associated with lower grey matter volume in the tracts' projection zones. Global mean 
  diffusivity was correlated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β1-42 but higher levels of 
  tau, phosphorylated-tau and soluble TREM2. Together, these results suggest that regionally selective 
  white matter degeneration occurs years before the estimated symptom onset.

  (NII == neuroinflammation imaging) 
  Elevated NII-derived cellular diffusivity was observed in both preclinical and early symptomatic 
  phases of AD, while disruption of WM integrity, as detected by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) 
  and increased radial diffusivity (RD), was only observed in the symptomatic phase of AD. This may 
  suggest that WM inflammation occurs earlier than WM damage following abnormal Aβ accumulation in AD. 
  The negative correlation between NII-derived cellular diffusivity and CSF Aβ42 level (a marker of 
  amyloidosis) may indicate that WM inflammation is associated with increasing Aβ burden. NII-derived FA 
  also negatively correlated with CSF t-tau level (a marker of neurodegeneration), suggesting that 
  disruption of WM integrity is associated with increasing neurodegeneration.

  Magnetization transfer ratio values were lower in patients with Alzheimer disease than 
  in healthy control participants in all investigated regions. When adjusting for atrophy and 
  extent of WM hyperintensities, significant differences were seen in the global cortex, in 
  Alzheimer disease–signature regions, in normal-appearing WM, and in WM hyperintensities. 
  The magnetization transfer ratio in these regions was an independent determinant of AD. 
  When correcting for atrophy and WM hyperintensity extent, lower GM magnetization transfer 
  ratios were associated with poorer global cognition, language function, and constructional praxis.

  Age was significantly associated with all but one diffusion parameters and regions of interest. 
  NDI and MD in the cingulate region adjacent to the cingulate cortex showed a significant association 
  with a composite measure of Executive Function and was proven to partially mediate the relationship 
  between aging and Executive Function decline. These results suggest that both DTI and NODDI parameters 
  are sensitive to age-related differences in white matter regions vulnerable to aging, particularly 
  among older adults at risk for AD.

  Mean squared displacement revealed widespread microstructural differences already between 
  Aβ-negative/tau-negative and Aβ-positive/tau-negative participants with a spatial distribution 
  that closely resembled the pattern of Aβ accumulation. In contrast, differences in cortical 
  thickness were clearly more limited. Mean squared displacement was also correlated with both 
  Aβ- and tau-PET uptake even independently from one another and from cortical thickness. 
  Further, the same metric exhibited significantly stronger correlations with PET uptake than 
  cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Mean squared displacement was also positively correlated with 
  GFAP with a pattern that resembles Aβ accumulation, and GFAP partially mediated the association 
  between Aβ accumulation and mean squared displacement. Further, impairments in executive functions 
  were significantly more associated with mean squared displacement values extracted from a meta-region 
  of interest encompassing regions accumulating Aβ early in the disease process, than with cortical 
  thickness (P < 0.05). Similarly, impairments in memory functions were significantly more associated 
  with mean squared displacement values extracted from a temporal meta-region of interest than with 
  cortical thickness (P < 0.05).

  - Brain ageing affects olygodendrocytes and the structure of myelin sheaths 
  ([Bowley _et al._, 2010](#bowley2010age)).
  - Myelin sheaths integrity is is associated with secondary neuroinflammation 
    (Safaiyan _et al._, [2016](#safaiyan2016age), [2021](#safaiyan2021white))
  - Oligodendrocytes support axonal energy metabolism and neuronal health 
    ([Griffiths _et al._, 1998](griffiths1998axonal); [Fünfschilling _et al._, 2012](#funfschilling2012glycolytic); 
    [Lee _et al._, 2012](#lee2012oligodendroglia); [Saab _et al._, 2016](#saab2016oligodendroglial)).
  - **Hypothesis:** loss of myelin integrity can be an upstream risk factor for neuronal Aβ deposition.
  - **Results:** identify genetic pathways of myelin dysfunction and demyelinating injuries as potent drivers of amyloid deposition in mouse models of AD.

  Why does myelin deteriorate with age?
  - Olygodendricytes live longer: low generation/turnover rate ([Yeung _et al._, 2014](#yeung2014dynamics)).
  - The specific cellular architecture of myelin makes protein and lipid turnover challenging and slow
    ([Toyama _et al._, 2013](#toyama2013identification); [Ando _et al._, 2003](#ando2003turnover)).
