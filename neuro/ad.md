  <summary>Notes</summary>
  This paper argues against a simple amyloid cascade and underlies the complex 
  interraction between .... <br />
  <b>Problem with the cascade hypothesis</b> <br />
  "Even in familial AD (FAD), where the role of Aβ is established because of 
  causative mutations in APP and Presenilin, the amyloid  hypothesis is found wanting. 
  Why, for instance, does abnormal Aβ production, already present from conception, 
  manifest its toxicity only in midlife?" <br/ >
  "In our view, AD only starts when a pathological cellular reaction is initiated." <br />
  <b>Biochemical phase (Aβ, tau)</b> <br />
  "The “biochemical phase” of AD is characterized by abnormal aggregation of Aβ and 
  potentially abnormal processing of APP; formation of Tau conformers followed 
  by hyper phosphorylation; the seeding and propagation in a prionoid fashion of 
  these abnormally folded proteins; the generation of oligomeric amyloids 
  (Aβo- and Tau-oligomers); and the generation of amyloid plaques and neuronal tangles." <br />
  "The temporal sequence of these events is undefined. " <br />
  "The separate locations of Tau and amyloid pathology and their natural progression in the brain 
  suggest that the two biochemical pathologies progress relatively independently from each other." <br />
  <b>Cellular phase</b> <br />
  "We see AD as a complex process consisting of different interacting phases encompassing feedback 
  and feedforward mechanisms between cells, which, after many years, lead to dementia." <br />
  "Most importantly, in this view, Aβ and Tau accumulations in SAD are considered risk factors—i.e.,
  even if their accumulation is a sign of increased proteopathic stress, additional cellular factors 
  are determinative in the evolution toward dementia. Instead of Aβ and Tau, the real causes of 
  sporadic disease are upstream of these proteopathies and are likely manifold, with aging being the major driver." <br />
  "Defective clearance of Aβ (and Tau), considered to underlie the majority of 
  sporadic AD cases, illustrates the complexity of the cellular response." <br />
  <b>Vascular aspect</b> <br />
  "The vascular hypothesis proposes that initial vascular damage precipitates AD. 
  Hypoperfusion and hypoxia are one aspect of the problem, but the associated breakdown of the 
  BBB also results in ... secondarily to defects in Aβ and Tau metabolism and clearance, 
  which in turn cause vascular problems such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)" <br />
  "Co-existence of AD and vascular pathology increases the risk for dementia considerably" <br />
  <b>Astroglial aspect</b> <br />
  "In contrast to neurons, the astroglia population is strikingly under-investigated in AD-related studies." <br />
  "The “reactive” astrogliosis in AD was noticed by Dr. Alzheimer himself." <br />
  "It is a physiological response and should, a priori, be considered a protective reaction; 
  however, in AD, it could contribute directly to defective clearance" <br />
  <b>Inflammation</b> <br />
  "A more integrated approach seems necessary to investigate the progressive inflammatory and 
  other responses, and a more comprehensive analysis of the role of the different cells 
  (microglia, but also astroglia and infiltrating monocytes) over the different stages of 
  the cellular phase of AD is needed. Indeed, what is beneficial in the beginning could 
  become destructive later. Finally, inflammation must be placed into the wider context of aging. 
  The AD brain carries the hallmarks of an inflammatory process, but it is also apparent 
  that age itself predisposes to inflammation—a concept that has been coined as “inflammaging.”"<br />
  <b>Myelin aspect</b> <br />
  "Braak suggested a link between vulnerability of neurons and their myelination stage because 
  the spreading of neurofibrillary tangles recapitulates the pattern of myelination in reverse order" <br />
  "Bartzokis goes even as far as to propose that the recently evolved extensive myelination 
  of the human brain explains increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders" <br />
  "Age-related myelin breakdown as assessed by MRI might indeed result in a progressive disconnection 
  of neural networks and presage AD"

  (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates <br />
  (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. <br />
  Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline.
  The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, 
  rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct 
  substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the 
  rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline.
