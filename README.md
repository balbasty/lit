# Literature review

This repository contains small literature reviews on different aspects of machine learning 
and medical imaging. Sometimes with nice notes, more often just a list of references.

## Table of content

- [Textbooks](textbooks.md): links to various textbooks

### Neural Nets

- [U-Net](unet.md): a look at the history of this architecture
- [Res-Net](resnet.md): residual networks, residual blocks, etc
- [Registration nets](regnet.md): a mix between spatial transformers and reigstration networks
- [Classification losses](catloss.md): Bayes-optimality
- [Bayesian nets](bayesnet.md): Dropout and uncertainty estimation with neural nets
- [Atrous nets](atrous.md): Dilating instead of pooling
- [GANs](gan.md): Generative adversarial networks
- [Image translation](image_translation.md)

### Old School Machine Learning

- [Variational Bayes](variational.md)
- [Markov Random Fields](mrf.md): MRFs and Boltzmann machines (+ some expectation-propagtion vs mean-field)

### MRI / Anatomy

- [Ex Vivo MRI](mrphysics/exvivo.md): Resources for scanning dead brains
- [Vasculature](vasculature.md): Vascular/Microvascular anatomy and modeling
